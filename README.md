# pandas-challenge

Weâ€™ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

We are analyzing data for our city's school district. In this capacity, we'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, we've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. We are given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
